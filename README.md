This is an Arduino project.
Purchase an Arduino and make sure to power it such as with a small usb battery pack and a resistor across the 3.3V pin.
One can control an R2 unit from Droid Depot with your voice rather than with the remote.
Essentially the arduino is used to analyse speech and send data over BLE to the small droid.
There is plenty of room to mount a small Arduino BLE Sense inside the body.
Accuracy with speech is much better when using impulse edge.
